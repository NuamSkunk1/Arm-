# verilog codes for an ARM-CPU
Our group members are:
1. Mina Fattahi
2. Farhang Doroudian

This project was done for our "logic circuits and architecture lab" class in Fall 2018.

In this project, we simulated an ARM CPU that has been described in "Computer Organization and Design (ARM edition)" book by Patterson, using verilog HDL codes.
